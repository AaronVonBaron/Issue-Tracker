### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Essentially, the borders look weird when two towns in the same faction have lines seperating the towns. Its weird and it makes the borders look all strange. Despite being in the same faction, it makes them look wonky.

### Describe the solution you'd like
I'd want an update on the map that would have a solid border to set apart the faction, and a dotted line to set apart the towns. Itll make the map look way nicer.


### Additional context
Not much, just what I said before. Making faction borders way more noticable, and dont have inter-town borders that are like dotted and less noticable.
